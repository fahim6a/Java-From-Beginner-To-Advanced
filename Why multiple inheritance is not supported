once you had made two superClass and implements those superClass
then multiple inheritance faced a problem
is there are any solutions?
yes, cpp(c++) already has solved this problem
Nevertheless, you can access multiple inheritance using interface.
java is a solid and sound oop language.

note:
1.interface in java a bit like a class but it has significant
difference
2. an interface has only method signature, field which is constant
and default methods
3. you can override your properties in the class but not necessary
4. the class implementing the interface must declare the methods
but not necessary the field.
5. you are not able to create an object of interface class
but java creators has been provided a reference option and
why not you are taking the full advantage of it. do it.
6. interface methods are public by defaults

interface syntax
first you must have to mention interface keyword.

interface name{
//methods name ()
}

//implements is a keyword. you must have declared.
class name implements interfaceName{
//methods name (){
//must be same method which already have been declared in the interface
}
}
